# reaktor-juniorFall2020

This is my implementation for Reaktor junior Fall 2020's pre-assignment. The app is deployed [here](https://hoang-reaktorfall2020.herokuapp.com/)

You can read about the assignment [here](https://www.reaktor.com/junior-dev-assignment/)

This project helped me get started with **React**, improved my **Python**, **html/css** skill, and gained some knowledge of deploying a web app on a live server.

The app's frontend was created using **React**. It fetches and shows information from an API endpoint, which can be seen in **dpkg_status** submodule.

### Usage
> git clone --recurse-submodules ht<span>tps://github.com/shilena91/reaktor-juniorFall2020.git
